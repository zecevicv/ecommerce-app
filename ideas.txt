My idea surrounding e-commerce website is that I practice JavaScript and OOP and therefore show my JavaScript skills. I can create one large project like this, with not so many pages. This one will have a main homepage, products (shop) page, single product page, cart which can be in a modal, checkout, and login. That would be a core of an ecommerce website. I can use this example to showoff my best practices front end skills. I can create everything from scratch and I think I personally would learn a lot. I could use no framework or library approach and practice creating all the things myself. I would use scss as a css preprocessor, vanilla javascript splited into modules and classes bundled, minified, and transpiled/pollyfilled code with webpack. And I can create a case study like document for my potential clients or web development companies. I can use this project to kill the fear. I can also master animations on this project which is a huge thing. I will practice lazy loading.

I know what this shop will be about: Formula 1 T-shirts!

Pages:

1) Homepage 
    -> Transparent navbar that turns into a white one on scrolling. Logo on the left, on the right three icons (search, cart, and login) which triggers an modal. Shopping cart icon should have an number somewhere near to it that shows the number of items in the cart. Each of these buttons should trigger an modal. Search should expand and showoff a search bar, cart should open an modal with items and go to cart/checkout button. And login should open an modal with a dummy login form and I will display email and password above just that user can check. On hover the navbar should turn white.
    -> Hero slider should have a visual indicator on which slide we are (left) and arrows to controll it on the right.
    -> Product slider.
    And that's it regarding the functionality on the homepage.

2) Single Product
    -> Product should have a title, old price, new price, id, colors, available sizes, quantity input and add to cart functionality, description, and reviews section with average rating and start.
    -> Product photos on the left are clickable and loads a different image everytime.
    -> There should be an lightbox gallery of some sort.

3) Products/Shop page
    -> Listing with pagination, how much products should we show, and sorting options. Filter sidebar with color, prices, and sizes, and maybe men/women switch since we'll have a single product type (ie. t-shirt or similar).

4) Multistep cart/checkout
    -> First step should be cart with products added to cart with the ability to edit the item and to delete it. With editing I mean quantity.
    -> Second step should be a simple dummy checkout with basic information like name, location, number, etc, delivery method and that should be it. Maybe I should display like: "Thank you for ordering the following products:" and down should be product information simplified.

5) Cart Popup & Login Popup
